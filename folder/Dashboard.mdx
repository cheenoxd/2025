**[project: Articuno](https://github.com/cuhacking/cuHacking-dashboard)**

---
The dashboard will be available at [https://live.cuhacking.com](https://live.cuhacking.com). From here, hackers can take advantage of a few additional services provided by the hackathon including announcements and an interactive map of the location.

# Content
The content is split into two stages, before the event and a week before/during the event.

## Pre-event
This stage will simply have a countdown to the event.

## A week before the event
The actual Dashboard. Split into a couple sections which can be reached by visiting different tabs.

### (Home) Updates/Announcements
A blog/feed type post system, with the countdown for time left for hacking at the top of the page.  
It would be cool if the countdown could be fixed to the navigation bar once moved out of view.
 
### Profile
Once logged in users can see their QR Badge, team information, and any personal mini-event information. They can also join a team through this interface.

### Teams
Here hackers will be able to see what project each team is working on.

### Schedule
The schedule for the 24-hour should be available in a tabulated version. Users can click on any event to find more details for the event. Logged in (and accepted) users can also favourite events so that they can be filtered into a short list and receive a push notification if signed into the app.

### Map
An interactive map for hackers to navigate the campus and the Richcraft Hall. This will also indicate the rooms to which hackers have access to. Clicking a room will show more details including all the events scheduled in the room.
