**[project: Ditto](https://github.com/cuhacking/cuHacking-admin)**

---

Ditto is an administration console used for operations/control of our data. Statistics and other more advanced features may be developed for post event data collection.

The Admin Console will take care of the tasks bellow.

# Account Management
The admin console will have the ability to create/edit/delete user data and list users that are currently in the database. This could include changing a users food group, editing a user's team, etc.

#### Functions
- Create account
- Accept account to hackathon
- Generate a paper badge (PDF) for an account, so it may be given to a hacker
- View internal hacker information
  - Information that was provided in their application, or generated info (food group, team, etc.)

# Event Management
The hackathon will have event schedule information and notifications being sent to hackers throughout the event, the admin console will have the ability to update this data and inform the backend that it should notify users.

#### Functions
- Add/Remove/Edit events
- Create scheduled announcements
- Broadcast announcements

# `WIP` Data Management
Possible features might also include a method by which we can perform statistical queries on the database to check different processes (such as who has checked in for food from what groups, etc) but these have yet to be fully planned.

Application acceptances will be done through the Admin Console's data management.

#### Functions
- Query for accounts (match all criteria or match any criteria)
