### Longer FAQs:
**1. Can I get more details about the add-on: run a workshop?**
* * If _**COMPANY**_ is interested in hosting an interactive workshop at our event, we'd offer this benefit for an additional 50. Workshops are a great opportunity to interact with the hackers and show what your company is all about. Running workshops which walk hackers through using a company product or API and challenging them to create a small project (which can be completed in a short period of time) is great for presenting your products. This may also make recruiting more effective; hackers which catch on to using your products quickly and who are interested in your line of work can make great co-op students or future employees.
