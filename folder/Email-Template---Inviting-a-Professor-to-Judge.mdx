Hello Professor __________, 

I am David Casciano, a member of the cuHacking Operations team. I would like to invite you to attend cuHacking 2020 on January 11 and 12, as a judge or mentor.

cuHacking started in 2017 as Ottawa's first MLH hackathon. From the beginning, our focus has been creating a community of students who are passionate about technology, learning, and teamwork. This year we are expecting over 400 students, from every skill level and field of study. 

Below is more information about judging and mentorship, further information can be found in the attached document. 

**Judging**

We have many volunteers and mentors to help the students tackle any of the challenges of their projects. We are looking to create a diverse group of professors to judge the student's creations at the end of the hackathon. Projects are evaluated based on their novelty, grit, technical skill, and functionality.
* Novelty: is it a new original idea?
* Grit: how did the team react when they encountered setbacks?
* Technical Ability: how advanced is their project (based on student's experience level)
* Functionality: How complete and functional is the project?

**Mentorship**

If you are not interested in judging, we also looking for professors to mentor at the event. You will be able to help students overcome challenges in their projects as a mentor, and if you wish you may be able to host a workshop during the event.
* If you wish to host a workshop feel free to contact me with the topic, and if there is space in the schedule we will slot you in.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or if you are interested in attending as a mentor or as a judge (or both).

Thank you for your time,

David Casciano
