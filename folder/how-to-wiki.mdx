This wiki was made so that the cuHacking organization could have one central source of knowledge. Although it may be daunting editing the wiki isn't hard, and it's actually encouraged! The more people contributing to the knowledge base, the better.

# Markdown

The wiki uses [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/) to process its pages. Please learn how to write in Markdown before you begin editing (again, it isn't hard).

### WIP

If you're still working on a page, let people know by putting `Work in progress` (styled like that) at the top of the page.

How do you style it like that? Type:

```
`Work in progress`
```

and it becomes
`Work in progress`

# Images

Using GitHub wiki comes with slight downsides. To display a local image (or any other local files, such as PDFs) in your markdown, it needs to be hosted online. The easiest way to do that is to upload it to the wiki itself! It can be done in a couple of easy steps.

1. Upload your file to the wiki's repository

   - Go to [this link](https://github.com/cuhacking/cuHacking-wiki/tree/master/resources)
   - On this page you'll see a button labeled `Upload files` between `Create new file` and `Find file`.
     ![Upload Page](https://github.com/cuhacking/cuHacking-wiki/blob/master/resources/repo-page.png)
   - Once that's clicked, press `choose your files` to upload your files
     ![Upload Page](https://github.com/cuhacking/cuHacking-wiki/blob/master/resources/upload-page.png)

   - Label your commit with the the format `Upload file1.png, file2.png, file3.pdf` or `Upload <the reason of your upload>`
     - Note that it says `Upload` and not `Uploaded`. It's standard commit format to write in the imperative tense/mood
   - Press `Commit changes`

2. Get the link to your image
   - Head back to [this page](https://github.com/cuhacking/cuHacking-wiki/tree/master/resources)
   - Click on your uploaded file
   - Copy the URL from the address bar
3. Use your image!
   - Anywhere in the wiki, include your image using Markdown, like this: `![my image](https://github.com/cuhacking/cuHacking-wiki/blob/master/resources/myImage.png)`

# Google Drive

If you're going to add something from our Drive, make sure that **the permissions are appropriate**. It's important that we keep our information safe from tampering, as the wiki is open to the internet.

Rules to go by for permissions:

- If it's just for the organization, you shouldn't have to change any permissions
- If it's for a single team only and is sensitive (i.e. Account info) access should only be for members of that team
- If it's for everyone to see, you should generate a sharable link where people link the link **can only view**
- Nothing should be editable by everyone

# Gotchas

- Links break really easily with GitHub wiki. Don't change a page name if you don't have to, and don't change resource file names either
- The wiki is a place for guides and explanations, not brainstorming
  - If you have some information people need to collaborate on, put it in a google doc and link to it from the wiki
- Don't nest pages further than one click from a page in the sidebar. There's no sitemap so it becomes difficult to go back and forth
