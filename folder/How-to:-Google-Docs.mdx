# Headings / Formatting

## Outline

You can add an outline to your document which appears on the left-hand-side with all the heading and subheadings.

## Applying Formats

You can apply title, header, or subtitle formats from the `Styles` menu option

/>

When you select it, the paragraph / text where the cursor is will convert to this format.

## Shortcuts

You can quickly create headings by pressing `cmd + option + 1` for Header 1. For Header 2, or Header 3, replace the number 1, with the corresponding number.

# Comments

You can add comments to any text by highlighting it and selecting the add comment button that appears on the right side of the page.

Once you do this, the commented text will be highlighted in yellow and you can add a comment in the dialog box.

## Assigning Tasks

If you want to assign a task to someone using comments you can write their email preceded by @.
