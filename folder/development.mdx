The Development Team (stylized as dev-team) is the largest team in the cuHacking organization.

Conventionally we handle the website that people see when visiting [cuhacking.com](https://cuhacking.com), however this year dev-team is creating a suite of services to augment the hacker (and organizer) experience. Collectively these services are dubbed _cuPlatform_.
