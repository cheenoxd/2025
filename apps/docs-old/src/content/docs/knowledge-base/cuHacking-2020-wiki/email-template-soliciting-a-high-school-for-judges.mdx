Hello Highschool,

My name is Anoushka and I am a student at Carleton University. I am reaching out to you on behalf of cuHacking hosted by Carleton University on January 11 and 12 2020.

cuHacking is a hackathon held over a weekend where students from different knowledge in coding come together and build a project. This event allows students who are passionate about technology to come together and learn from each other.

cuHacking started in 2017 as Ottawaâ€™s first MLH hackathon. Our goal was to create a community of students who share the same passion or want more insight. During this hackathon, we challenge students to think outside of the box with absolutely no hacking involved. We host more than just one event, we host games, activities and talks. This is an opportunity for students to win cool prizes and make real-world connections.

Last year, we noticed the lack of high school participants at the event. This year, our goal is to expand this experience to high school students as well. This year, we would like to change that by inviting high school students from all over Ottawa to attend our hackathon. This is an opportunity for them to not only network but learn what they are interested in.

We have included our brochure as well. If you have any more questions, feel free to email me. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Kind Regards,

Anoushka Singhal
