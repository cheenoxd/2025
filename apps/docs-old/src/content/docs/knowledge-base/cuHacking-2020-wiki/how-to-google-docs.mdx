# Table of Contents

## How to Insert Table of Contents

Insert a table of contents directly into your google doc by selecting it from the menu options `Insert > Table of Contents`, and then selecting which format you would prefer.

# Headings / Formatting

## Outline

You can add an outline to your document which appears on the left-hand-side with all the heading and subheadings.

## Applying Formats

You can apply title, header, or subtitle formats from the `Styles` menu option

/>

When you select it, the paragraph / text where the cursor is will convert to this format.

## Shortcuts

You can quickly create headings by pressing `cmd + option + 1` for Header 1. For Header 2, or Header 3, replace the number 1, with the corresponding number.

# Comments

You can add comments to any text by highlighting it and selecting the add comment button that appears on the right side of the page.

  src="/cuhacking-2020-images/google-docs-comments.png"
/>

Once you do this, the commented text will be highlighted in yellow and you can add a comment in the dialog box.

## Assigning Tasks

If you want to assign a task to someone using comments you can write their email preceded by @.
