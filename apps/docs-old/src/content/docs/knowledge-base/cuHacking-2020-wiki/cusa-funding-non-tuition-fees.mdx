title: CUSA Funding + Non-Tuition Fees
---

_Due to the government’s Student Choice Initiative we can now opt-out of certain student fees, but this can affect our CUSA funding._

## CUSA Funding

Every semester we apply for funding through CUSA which allows us to buy the things we need to run cuHacking events. Last year we received about $1400 from them.

This year, since the government has mandated that students be allowed to opt out of non-tuition fees, we are able to opt-out of funding CUSA Clubs and Societies.

In order to ensure that their funding does not drop, CUSA has made it mandatory that clubs that apply for funding, do not opt-out of CUSA’s Clubs and Societies fee:

- _All leaders on CUSA Hub must **not** opt-out of CUSA’s Clubs and Societies fee._
- _The more members on CUSA Hub that do **not** opt-out of CUSA’s Clubs and Societies fee, the more funding we will get._

## Optional Non-Tuition Fees

In order to opt-out of other fees — or make sure that you haven’t opted-out of CUSA’s Clubs and Societies fee — you have to go to [carleton central](https://central.carleton.ca).

![optional-fees](/cuhacking-2020-images/optional-fees.png)

Select Optional Non-Tuition Fees, and for **both** semesters select which fees you want to opt-out of.

Make sure the checkbox beside the following fees are **unselected** since this will cause us to get less money when we apply for funding.

- **Student Life and Success Programs**
- **Student Opportunities and Space**
- **Clubs & Societies**

For more information about optional non-tuition fees, see this [page](https://carleton.ca/studentaccounts/tuition-fees/optional-non-tuition-fees/) from Carleton.

## CUSA Hub

All Leaders on CUSA Hub **must remain opted-in** for CUSA’s Clubs and Societies fee in order to receive any funding from CUSA that semester.

The more members we have that join us on CUSA hub — and also remain opted-in for CUSA’s Clubs and Societies fee — the more funding we will receive.

You can join cuHacking’s [CUSA Hub page](https://cusahub.ca/campusvibe/group/a89a7547-a041-47b3-904d-8401cc7a367c/54043249-1e76-41d0-9b62-d0d26b99e456). This will help us receive more funding.
