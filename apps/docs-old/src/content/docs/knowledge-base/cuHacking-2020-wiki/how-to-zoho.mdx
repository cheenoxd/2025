_Brief overview of how to log in and use Zoho Mail._

## Introduction
Some teams have their own accounts. You can find all the cuHacking emails [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PnAqQ6T-KWycn5anhSFcyLENLTGmqmiIWSRyXMTHdRE/edit?usp=sharing).
* Some teams will have personalized aliases for each team member in order to create a more personal relationship between us and sponsors / contacts
* The inbox is still shared by the team, even with aliases

## Logging In
You can log in to your Zoho Mail account at https://accounts.zoho.com/signin.
* Login credentials will be provided by your team leader

## Signatures
It is important to have consistent email signatures so that we present a professional image.

Make sure it follows the following design:

Purple (12pt, Verdana), Gray (10.5pt, Verdana), and Black (10.5pt, Verdana) – this preserves the colours for the cuhacking colour scheme.

### Example

**Important:** make sure to associate your signature to your alias (if applicable).

This is where you paste your signature.

## Assigning Emails
You can add tags to emails to assign them to certain team members, and to track who’s responsible for responding to which emails.
