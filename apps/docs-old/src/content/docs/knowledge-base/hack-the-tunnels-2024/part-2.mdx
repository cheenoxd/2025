import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

When you type things into Google docs, it autosaves and you can see the version history.

What if we want to see the version history of our file?
What if we want to have multiple versions of the file without having multiple copies?
What if we want to let others change our file without over-writing our changes?

Git solves these problems for us. Let's use it.

<div className="steps">

<div className="step">
### Experience Git Visually

Just like we learned how to move first inside Linux, we'll learn to move with Git.

Let's have some fun with this [Git Visualizer](https://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/#free) first and find out it is :)
</div>

<div className="step">
### Making commits

```txt title="git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/"
git commit
```

You'll see a new bubble. Bubbles are fun, let's make another one.

```txt title="git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/"
git commit
```

You'll see another bubble. Nice.

Do this as many times as you like to see more commits.
</div>

<div className="step">

### See history

```txt title="git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/"
git log
```

This is the history of the commits you've made so far, similar to the version history of a Google Doc.

We can see that the first commit has a message, that says `first commit`. The commits after don't have messages.
</div>

<div className="step">
### Commit with messages

Let's start over. Press 'OK' for the browser popup after running the command.
```txt title="git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/"
clear
```

Now, we've all got that one friend that claims that they've got a degree in rizzology. Somehow, this one friend always happens to be the single one.

One day, your friend tells you they have a crush on someone.

<Accordions>


<Accordion title="What do friends do when they have a crush on someone?">
 Why of course! They ask you for advice üòÇ
</Accordion >
</Accordions>

You give your friend all the advice you can, and they still completely goof it up.

We ask our friend if they're using git, and they're not. No wonder why their crush left them on read. Your friend says:

> But git's so hard to learn üò≠

What do you do? Well of course, you just hit 'em with the good old....

> Plenty of fish in sea üêüÔ∏è

It hasn't even been two weeks, and your friend has a crush on another person.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What do friends do when they have a crush on someone?">
 Why of course! They show you pictures. üì±
</Accordion >
</Accordions>

Your friend shows you their crushes' instagram, and let's be honest, you don't really care. But you want to be a good friend so you roll with it.

As friends always do, they hit you with the good old:

> Oh it's just a bad picture I swear they look better in real life

You're curious so you look at it.

<Callout type="warn" title="UH OH">
Oh no, your friend's crush's friend do be looking kinda cute. üò∂
</Callout>

So you start gassing up your friend and asking them to text their crush, and they hit you with:

> I'm not following your advice and getting left on read again

Now, that's outrageous üò°

To be honest, git do be a little initimidating. And you care about our friend. You don't want them to goof up again. A win for your friend is a win for you, right?.

So we're going to show them how rizzology is done right using git.

Let's get to work and text our friend's crush.

```txt title="git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/"
git commit -m "you: hey"
```

```txt title="git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/"
git commit -m "them: hi"
```

```txt title="git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/"
git commit -m "you: how's everything going"
```

```txt title="git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/"
git commit -m "them: good hbu"
```

```txt title="git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/"
git commit -m "you: pretty good hbu"
```

```txt title="git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/"
git commit -m "them: lol"
```

Huh? ü§®

Your friend is excited that your rizzology degree is paying off, and you made their crush **lol**.

But deep down, you know you didn't say anything funny. You're a little worried.ü§î

Time to investigate. Let's put on our hacker hoodies, and find out.

```txt title="git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/"
git log
```

```txt
 b10f6d7 them: lol
 fce5c0b you: pretty good hbu  // [!code highlight]
 f212002 them: good hbu
 56c6023 you: how's everything going
 b7d0046 them: hi
 b27172 you: hey
```

<Callout type="warn" title="UH OH">
We put a 'hbu' at the end üò± Whoops üò¨
</Callout>

üö® You scramble. üö®

```txt title="git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/"
git commit -m "you: pretty good*"
```

GG. You embarrassed yourself, and you're also about to get your friend left on read.üíÄ

Your friend starts to panic, and you tell them to calm down.

Git to the rescue. Let's show our friend its time travel powers.
</div>

<div className="step">
### Resetting commits
We need to pick a point in time to travel back to and try to un-oopsie this.

```txt title="git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/"
git reset
```

It doesn't work. And your friend panics, as friends always do.

Looking closer at the log we notice that each commit has a **hash identifier**.

Let's find the hash of `pretty good hbu` and reset to it.

```txt
// [!code word:fce5c0b]
 ef29994 you: pretty good
 b10f6d7 them: lol
 fce5c0b you: pretty good hbu  // [!code highlight]
 f212002 them: good hbu
 56c6023 you: how's everything going
 b7d0046 them: hi
 b27172 you: hey
```

Bingo. The hash is pretty long, but it looks like it's **unique**.

Let's try just the **first three** characters.

```txt title="git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/"
git reset fce
```

Did it work? Let's check.

```txt title="git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/"
git log
```

```txt
 fce5c0b you: pretty good hbu
 f212002 them: good hbu
 56c6023 you: how's everything going
 b7d0046 them: hi
 b27172 you: hey
```

Okay, looks like that worked. Phew. üòÖ
</div>

<div className="step">
### Renaming commits

Now let's quickly fix our oopsie.

```txt title="git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/"
git commit --amend -m "you: pretty good"
```

You'll see that the previous commit turned white, and a new one appeared at the same level.

We've erased the white commits forever, or have we? Time will tell.
</div>

<div className="step">
### Resetting commits

Time elapses, and it tells nothing. Our friend's crush doesn't reply.

This is concerning. The imposter syndrome starts to hit you.

Are you truly a rizzologist? Is it truly GG? üò∞

Let's find out.

```txt title="git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/"
git log
```

Looking at the conversation, you start to feel very thirsty. üåµ

```txt
 662c147 you: pretty good // [!code highlight]
 f212002 them: good hbu // [!code highlight]
 56c6023 you: how's everything going
 b7d0046 them: hi
 b27172 you: hey
```


<Callout type="warn" title="UH OH">
üö® Houston, we got a very dry conversation. üö®
</Callout>
</div>

Quick quick, let's see if they'll be at hack the tunnels.

With our rizzology skills, let's abbreviate it so that they they can't help but reply when they read it.

```txt title="git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/"
git commit -m "you: you going to htt?"
```

You get a reply.

```txt title="git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/"
git commit -m "them: htt?"
```

Phew. Looks, like your friend won't doubt your rizzology skills after all.

```txt title="git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/"
git commit -m "you: hack the tunnels"
```

```txt title="git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/"
git commit -m "them: yes, git workshop"
```

</div>

To be continued...
