## üì¶ Overview

### What it does

This library allows for typechecking environment variables or secrets which are consumed by the applications.
This uses [t3-oss/t3-env](https://github.com/t3-oss/t3-env), with type validation using [Zod](https://zod.dev/).
These variables can be imported with full type safety by any apps or libraries.

### Key Features

- Provides full type-safety to environment variables
- Helps easily detect missing or invalid environment variables
- Improves security by providing access to specific variables for certain library/app

### How to use

#### Basic Usage Example


Assuming environment variables in the `.env.example` files are set in a `.env` file, they can be imported & consumed:

```tsx
import { envWebsiteDb } from '@cuhacking/env'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  dbCredentials: {
    url: envWebsiteDb.DATABASE_URL,
  },
})
```

`envWebsiteDb.DATABASE_URL` will have type-safety up to its configurations.
Based on the following configurations:

```tsx
export const envWebsiteDb = createEnv({
  // ...
  server: {
    DATABASE_URL: z.string().url().startsWith('postgres'),
  },
})
```

The library would throw an error if the environment variable:
1. Is missing (or is not defined in the correct directory)
2. Is not a string
3. Is not a URL
4. Does not start with 'postgres'

## üìñ API Reference

### `envWebsiteDb`

- **Properties**
  - `DATABASE_URL: string`: PostgreSQL database connection string.

### `envWebsiteServer`

- **Properties**
  - `AUTH_SECRET: string`: Lucia server-side authentication secret
  - `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID: string`: Google authentication crendential ID
  - `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET: string`: Google authentication credential secret

Any environment variables that should be shared with all other set of variables should
be placed in `shared.ts`

### Error Handling

When using an environment variable through this library, your IDE should pick up
type mismatches because of type-safety ‚ú®

## üõ†Ô∏è Commands

### View all commands

To view all commands from the library's `project.json`, `package.json` and inheritted:
```sh title="Terminal"
pnpm nx show project env
```

### Focus library usage

To view/focus on all the apps & libraries which use this library:
```sh title="Terminal"
pnpm nx graph --focus env
```

## üìù Contributing

### Best Practices

#### Code Formatting

The directories of the environment variables definitions are named after the apps they represent.
For example, the environment variables for `website` are found in `env/src/website`.
To add a new environment variable,  create a `.ts` file representing
the set of environment variables for the certain portion of the app/library.

The library should be linted without any errors:
```sh title="Terminal"
pnpm nx run env:lint
```

#### Testing

To run tests for this library:
```sh title="Terminal"
pnpm nx run env:test
```

## ‚ùì FAQs

### What happens if I don't declare new environment variables in the library?

The library will not pick up any additional environment variables thrown in the environment variables files.
Therefore, it is best practice to begin by declaring the *expected* variable with its types in the library,
and then providing it in the `.env` file. Afterwards, don't forget to include an example (not your own key)
in the respected `.env.example` file. 

### Can I just use `process.env.<VAR_NAME>`?

There are many reasons why we specifically use this wrapper library. Those were mentioned above, and for that
reason, using `process.env` should be the last option.

## üõë Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

#### Invalid environment variable(s)

Invalid environment variables should be picked up either in build-time or run-time.
An error code of the sort means that the environment variable is either missing, or not in the correct directory:
```sh title="Terminal"
‚ùå Invalid environment variables: { DATABASE_URL: [ 'Required' ] }
```
How cool this is? The kindest type of error you can get! üòÅ
