# Workflow Execution Guide

To run the script, use either one of these commands in the CLI to run a specific workflow:

1. `npm run online` --> for submitting online events
2. `npm run in-person` --> for submitting in-person events
3. `npm run hybrid` --> for submitting hybrid events

This will compile and automatically run a workflow for that specifc type of form.
