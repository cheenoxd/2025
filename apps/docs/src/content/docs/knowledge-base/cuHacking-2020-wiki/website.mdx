The [website](https://cuhacking.com) is where hackers get their first impression of cuHacking. From here people will be able to decide if the event is good *before* the attend the event.

Last year's website can be found at [2019.cuhacking.com](https://2019.cuhacking.com). It's repository can be found [here](https://github.com/cuhacking/cuHacking-website-2019).

The sections below will be added into the site once they're complete (for instance, the schedule section will not be on the site until the event itinerary is finalized).

# Content
The website is a single page web application that consists of sections, each with their own purpose. The content is split into stages, using later stages once we get closer to the hackathon and have more information to display.

### Navigation bar
All stages except the promotion stage will have this component. The bar at the top of the website should contains links to most of the sections of the site, which would scroll to them when clicked.

## Stage 1
This is when the team has been formed and cuHacking is being planned. Consists of the date and location. Also can collect emails for a newsletter.

## Stage 2
When more information has been collected, but when it's also before/while acquiring sponsors. It will consist of the following sections.

### Landing
This is the first section the user sees when visiting the website. One glimpse at this section should establish the hackathon's style and theme, and should give the user an understanding of when and where the hackathon is taking place.

"Applications coming soon! Stay tuned."

The user should also be able to input their email to be added to a mailing list for updates.

### About
After reading this section, a user should be able to understand *what* the event is about and *why* they should be interested in going.

### Sponsors
A section containing logos (with links) to all the sponsors sponsoring the event. This section grows as we get more sponsors.

### Become a sponsor
A section with details on how to sponsor.

### Footer
The bottom of the website. Links to social medias, Terms of Use Agreement, and Privacy Policy will all be here. "Made with (heart emoji) by students at Carleton", and "Questions? Send us an email at info@cuhacking.com" will be here too.

## Stage 3

# Applications
Aspiring hackers will have create an account for the entire cuHacking platform. This account will be used during the application process, and if they are accepted - to manage a Hacker's access to [Articuno](https://github.com/cuhacking/cuHacking-wiki/wiki/Dashboard) (the Hacker dashboard) and [Latios/Latias](https://github.com/cuhacking/cuHacking-wiki/wiki/Mobile-App) (the mobile apps). 

When applications first open, the website will have a large 'Apply to cuHacking 2020' button that will lead to account creation, and then to the rest of the application process. The account will require a first name, last name, email address, phone number, and require the user to create a password. Once they are accepted, that same account will be used for registration and _potentially_ team management/creation on the dashboard.
