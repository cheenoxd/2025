The Development Team (stylized as dev-team) is the largest team in the cuHacking organization. 

Conventionally we handle the website that people see when visiting [cuhacking.com](https://cuhacking.com), however this year dev-team is creating a suite of services to augment the hacker (and organizer) experience. Collectively these services are dubbed *cuPlatform*.

cuPlatform consists of the following (yes, we named them after PokÃ©mon):

- <Link href={WEBSITE}>Snorlax</Link> - The main website: [cuhacking.com](https://cuhacking.com)
- <Link href={DASHBOARD}>Articuno</Link> - The dashboard: [live.cuhacking.com](https://live.cuhacking.com)
- <Link href={MOBILE_APP}>Latios & Latias</Link> - The iOS and Android apps respectively
- <Link href={APPLICATION_SERVER}>Magneton</Link> - Our API
- <Link href={ADMIN_CONSOLE}>Ditto</Link> - The admin console

The following chart describes how they depend on each other.
