### Creating repositories

You're at Hack the Tunnels. Your friend wants to impress their crush somehow.

We need a way to share the cool thing we made with them. Let's turn that into a repository.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What's a repository?">
_Repository_ is just a fancy term for a _directory_ that is version controlled by Git.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

Navigate back to your VS Code Terminal and do the following.

```sh title="Terminal"
git init .
```

Now let's make a commit.

```sh title="Terminal"
git commit
```

You should see.
```sh
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        file.sh

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
</div>

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Why did that not work?">
Git won't version control files unless you to tell it to.

This gives you flexibility and saves you from oopsie situations where you may end up sharing files you didn't mean to, such as those containing your passwords.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

<div className="step">
### Adding files

Let's tell git to **track** changes to the file we want to commit.
```sh title="Terminal"
git add file.sh
```
```sh title="Terminal"
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

You should see:
```sh
[main (root-commit) d8f6d74] first commit
 1 file changed, 11 insertions(+)
 create mode 100755 file.sh
```
</div>


<div className="step">
### Pushing to remote

Great, now we need to actually send the link to this somehow. We can use GitHub for this.

It will host a **remote** version of the repository that our friend can download.

```sh title="Terminal"
gh repo create
```
We don't want to create a new repository, but rather push an existing one.

```txt
? What would you like to do?  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
  Create a new repository on GitHub from scratch
  Create a new repository on GitHub from a template repository
> Push an existing local repository to GitHub // [!code highlight]
```
Leave the path as is, and hit enter.
```txt
? What would you like to do? Push an existing local repository to GitHub
? Path to local repository (.) // [!code highlight]
```

Leave the Repository name as is, and hit enter.
```txt
? What would you like to do? Push an existing local repository to GitHub
? Path to local repository .
? Repository name (hack-the-tunnels-git-workshop) // [!code highlight]
```

Select your personal account as the owner, and hit enter.
```txt

  ```

You can provide it any description you like. Since we're in a hurry, we'll leave it blank.
```txt
? What would you like to do? Push an existing local repository to GitHub
? Path to local repository .
? Repository name hack-the-tunnels-git-workshop

Leave it as public.
```txt

? Description

  ```

Hit enter to add the remote.

Hit enter, leave it as origin.

At this point you're done :)

Navigate to the url in the final line to see your git repository hosted on GitHub.

Nice, now your friend can get your cool stuff with:

```sh title="Terminal"
# Replace my GitHub user ID with yours
gh repo clone <your-github-id>/hack-the-tunnels-git-workshop
```

<Callout title="The format for what comes after `gh repo clone` is the same as shown on the top left of your GitHub repo.">
</Callout>


</div>

<div className="step">
### Creating and renaming branches

Your friend calls you over...

<Callout type="warn" title="UH OH">
Your crush is there too. We need to impress them somehow.
</Callout>

Your friend has the same code as you and your crush has probably already seen it.

Your cool thing must not look the same as theirs. You need to quickly make changes and save them to a different version of the file.

Let's see the branch we're currently on.
```sh title="Terminal"
git branch
```
```
* main
```
If you see `(END)`, press <kbd>q</kbd> to quit.

Make a new branch called `my-branch`.
```sh title="Terminal"
git checkout -b main
```
```
Switched to a new branch 'my-branch'
```

Check the branch you're on again.
```sh title="Terminal"
git branch
```

```
* my-branch
  main
```

Make some changes to your file, run them to check that they work and commit them.
```txt title="file.sh"
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hack the Tunnels"
cowsay -f milk "Hack the Tunnels" | lolcat // [!code highlight]
cowsay -f dragon "Hack the Tunnels" | lolcat // [!code highlight]
cowsay -f cupcake "Hack the Tunnels" | lolcat // [!code highlight]
cowsay -f meow "Hack the Tunnels" | lolcat // [!code highlight]
```

```sh title="Terminal"
./file.sh
```

```sh title="Terminal"
git commit -m "change cowsays"
```

That didn't seem to work. This is because git doesn't automatically mark your changes to be committed.

Let's stage them.
```sh title="Terminal"
git stage file.sh
```

Now try again.
```sh title="Terminal"
git commit -m "change cowsays"
```

```txt
[main 94251e9] change cowsays
1 file changed, 4 insertions(+), 9 deletions(-)`
```

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Why did that happen?">
Similar to how we had to `git add` the file, to **track** it, we also need to `git stage` our changes to the file.

The staging area holds the changes we want to be included in the commit. It's like a truck into which you choose what to load before it's sent.

This may seem a bit odd at first. Over time you'll realize that it's incredibly powerful as it provides you flexibility to pick and choose what you want to commit.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

Nice.

Let's change the `echo` to something cooler, like `figlet`, and RGB it as well.
```txt title="file.sh"
#!/bin/bash
figlet "Hack the Tunnels" | lolcat // [!code highlight]
cowsay -f milk "Hack the Tunnels" | lolcat
cowsay -f dragon "Hack the Tunnels" | lolcat
cowsay -f cupcake "Hack the Tunnels" | lolcat
cowsay -f meow "Hack the Tunnels" | lolcat
```

```
./file.sh: line 2: figlet: command not found
```

Uh oh, do we have `figlet` installed? Let's check.

```sh title="Terminal"
figlet
```
```
bash: command not found: figlet
```

Looks like we don't. Let's install it and try again.
```sh title="Terminal"
brew install figlet
```
```sh title="Terminal"
./file.sh
```

It works! We can both stage and commit it in one go with `-am`
```sh title="Terminal"
git commit -am "replace echo with figlet"
```
See if everything worked and what the current state of our repository is.
```sh title="Terminal"
git status
```

```sh title="Terminal"
git log
```

Let's push our changes to remote.
```sh title="Terminal"
git push
```
You will see:
```
fatal: The current branch main has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin main

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.
```

This is because GitHub (upstream) doesn't have the `main` branch that we created locally.

So we do:
```sh title="Terminal"
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

```txt
Enumerating objects: 8, done.
Counting objects: 100% (8/8), done.
Delta compression using up to 16 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Writing objects: 100% (6/6), 622 bytes | 622.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 6 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), completed with 1 local object.
remote:
remote: Create a pull request for 'main' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/MFarabi619/hack-the-tunnels-git-workshop/pull/new/main
remote:
To https://github.com/MFarabi619/hack-the-tunnels-git-workshop.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
branch 'main' set up to track 'origin/main'.
```

Now you can find your branch on GitHub.

</div>

<div className="step">
### Switching between branches

Let's see what the file looked like before on the other branch.
```sh title="Terminal"
git checkout main
```

You'll see `file.sh` change to the version it was before.

Back to `my-branch`:
```sh title="Terminal"
git checkout my-branch
```

There are many more git commands, and this barely scratches the surface.

What will be the outcome of your adventure? It's the one you create here in present :)
