---

## üì¶ Overview

### What it does

This library brings a single tRPC API endpoint to perform actions on procedures easily with type-safety‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.

### Key Features

- Single endpoint
- Organized routing directories
- Context easily provided to endpoints
- Full type-safety

### How to use

#### Basic Usage Example

Assume a `hello` procedure defined in the `api` library, in a `user` route:
```ts
import { createRouter, publicProcedure } from '../../trpc'

export const userRouter = createRouter({
  hello: publicProcedure.query(({ ctx }: { ctx: any }) => {
    return {
      message: `Hello, ${ctx?.user?.name ?? 'world'} from tRPC!`,
    }
  }),
})
```

Here, `ctx` is the context provided by the user on every request (containing the user, session, etc).
This is `publicProcedure`, meaning authentication is not required to access it.

To call this procedure, import `api` from the tRPC implementation in the app or library, and use it:

```ts
import { api } from '../lib/trpc/server'

const hello = await api.user.hello()
```

## ‚ùì FAQs

### How can I add a new route?

Begin by copying the template for routes. Define your procedures, and then make sure to import the router
into the `AppRouter`, found in `src/index.ts`.

## üõë Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

#### Error accessing a route / Redirected to login page

The user accessing a protected route needs to be authenticated, no matter the authorization levels.
Additionally, authentication needs to be properly configured with its environment variables.
