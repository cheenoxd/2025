## ðŸ“¦ Overview

### What are libraries?

Libraries in this repository are used throughout applications & other libraries.
Modularizing them in this way allows for easy testing and configuration.
This also allows us to focus on specific changes to parts of business logic.

### List of libraries
- `api`: Type-safe API using tRPC
- `auth`: Authentication functionality provider
- `db`: Database interactor with DrizzleORM
- `utils`: Utility functions and constants
