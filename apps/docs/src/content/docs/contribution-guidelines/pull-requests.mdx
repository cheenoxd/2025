  Just in case you forgot: Rebasing onto `main` before continuing work is the
  secret to happiness.

## Always Simple Rebase

Always simple rebase your branch onto main before creating a pull request. This ensures that your branch is up to date with the latest changes in the main branch. Branch and PR rules are set up for the repo just in case as a guardrail.

Do your best to close a single issue per pull request, and always use the exact same PR title as the issue name. This makes debugging easier later. If the current issue is blocking the next, simply create a new branch off the branch for the pull request and continue working on the next issue on that branch. This technique is called [branch stacking](https://medium.com/@lneves12/git-how-to-stack-multiple-git-branches-and-rebase-them-like-a-pro-91c0cdf67ef). With the power of `git rebase`, you can continually apply PR feedback for the first branch while making progress for the next task on the second branch. Once again, [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) makes this very quick and easy to do cleanly.

## Pull Request Guidelines

When creating a Pull Request (PR), be mindful about what you're trying to contribute and the type of contribution: 
- Be sure to checkout [Branching Guidelines](/docs/contribution-guidelines/branching-guidelines), [Coding Guidelines](/docs/contribution-guidelines/coding-guidelines) and [Commit Conventions](/docs/contribution-guidelines/conventional-commits) before making a PR.
- Use the appropriate template that matches with your branch type.
- Ensure your PR scope and subject align with your main commit(s).
- If your code isnâ€™t fully ready to be merged, consider creating a draft PR instead.
- Be sure to link your PR branches with the according issue (if applicable).

If you're getting tired of storing work in progress by stashing changes or amending commits and then switching branches, it's a great sign to look into using [Git Worktrees](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/Use-this-git-worktree-add-example-and-never-switch-branches-again).
