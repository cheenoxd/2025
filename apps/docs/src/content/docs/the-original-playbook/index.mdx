This wiki is a hub for members of the organization. Here you'll find explanations of how each team operates, and any other information pertinent to the creation of the hackathon.

We use [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Iqr9PwGLgb-TdP51RtM_up57HBNuIAT4?usp=sharing) to share all of our files and documents and [Trello](https://trello.com/cuhacking2020) to manage our tasks within teams. Check out the [Roadmap](https://trello.com/b/6fbmSGfq) to see how tasks are managed between teams.
