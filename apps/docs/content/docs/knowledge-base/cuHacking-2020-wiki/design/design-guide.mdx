### Brainstorming 

  - *Smaller* tasks will have only one person coming up with possible designs and being responsible for taking the best approach possible based on the brand.
  - **Bigger** tasks will require a team session to have the artistic input of the entire team. This will take place during a weekly or bi-weekly basis depending on deadlines.

---

### Drafting - Round 1

  - Once the best idea has been reached, it will require a **rough** draft of such design. This design will be very structure and colour focused. (To see where things are put in a page, etc). 
  - Keep in mind this stage is very *quick*. Should take less than an hour.

---

### Feedback loop - Round 1

  - Once a draft has been finished, we will have to upload it to Invision. This will allow the external team to give feedback on the design without cluttering slack. 
  - The team will have a *quick* feedback meeting as soon as drafts are finished. The design lead must approve of the current design or give feedback for the second draft stage. This stage is **optional** for other designers on the team.

---

### Drafting - Round 2

  - The main objective of this stage is to integrate any changes and feedback indicated on the feedback loop. 
  - This draft should still be kept very simple.

---

### Feedback loop - Round 2

  - The objetive of this stage is to finalize the current stage to move the design to the final stage. 
  - This will require a *quick* meeting with the design lead. Other designers may join if they wish to.

---

### Finalize (Production)

 - This stage will very likely be the longest stage of the design process.
 - The objective is to make the material as clean and polished as possible.
 - This will very likely involve: 
    - Fill designs with content
    - Integrate any animation aspects of the design
    - Export the design in the required format (PDF, PNG, SVG, etc).
