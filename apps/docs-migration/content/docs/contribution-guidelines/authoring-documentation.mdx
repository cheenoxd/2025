### Use Headings
Use [GFM](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What's GFM?">
GFM stands for 'GitHub Flavoured Markdown'.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

- Use **bold** to allow skimming.
- Use **Lists** to express key points instead of using English connectives.
- Use **Tables** to express different things like conditions, and properties.
  - This is particularly powerful to avoid having a lot of 'if's to describe complex conditions.

```ts title="Code Snippet"
// [!code word:useCodeBlocks]
if (docs.content === 'TECHNICAL'){ // [!code highlight]
useCodeBlocks()
console.log('Deleted code'); // [!code --]
console.log('Added code'); // [!code ++]
}
```
