## Using Lazygit and Linux/Unix (literally anything \*nix)

For Windows users, the use of [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) is highly encouraged in order to avoid those rare, maddening, a-tiny-part-of-this-one-library-breaks issues that can be very hard to debug.

{" "}
<Callout type="warn">
  Ubuntu LTS' `apt` package manager is version locked. Use
  [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) instead to install the latest versions of
  packages.
</Callout>

Using [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) is highly encouraged, as it provides a visual [terminal user interface (TUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) to manage your commits, branches, staging areas, stashes, and much more. These are common occurences as we do [Trunk-Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/).

It's also significantly easier to resolve merge conflicts, cherry-pick commits between branches, squash them, amend a few commits back, checkout a specific commit, stage in hunks, etc. You'll be able to unlock the full power of Git without having to memorize all the commands.

    No you don't. WSL can run in the VS Code terminal, or any other
    IDE terminal. Rather than cloning the repo on your Windows filesystem, you'd be
    cloning it in a directory of your choice in the GNU/Linux OS.

    You can still access the windows filesystem from WSL and vice versa, browsing through the Linux
    directories with the Windows file explorer graphically.
