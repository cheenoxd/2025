Welcome to cuHacking's fun, interactive Git Workshop at [**Hack the Tunnels**](https://ccss.carleton.ca/hackthetunnels/), hosted by [**CCSS**](https://ccss.carleton.ca).

<Callout title='These pages are a standalone reference for you to:'>
- Follow along at your own pace
- Get un-stuck if you have any problems
- Speed ahead and dive deeper
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn" title="It's highly recommended to complete your setup in advance for a smooth experience.">

<Callout type="error" title="If someone says to `rm -rf /`, do NOT do that! üòÇ">
This is equivalent to <kbd>Alt+F4</kbd>, but instead of closing the open program, it will delete your whole operating system üòÇ

This workshop will be split into <u>3</u> parts.

### 1. Automating cool things

And steal some jobs from AI.

### ‚ùìÔ∏èFrequently asked Questions
  <Accordions>
    <Accordion title="Do I need to know how to code?">
    Nope, you don't need to know anything about coding :)

This workshop assumes no prior technical knowledge. It's very beginner-friendly and does not care about one's background or field of study.

You can also use this to teach others what you've learned.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Do I need to be super tech-y and be good with computers?">
    Nope, computers are hard. We struggle with computers ourselves too. As a matter of fact, we specialize in it :)
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Do I need to bring anything?">
    Just the following:
    - Laptop üíªÔ∏è
    - Charging Cable üîå
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="How do I get the most out of this workshop?">
    Most technical workshops we've seen at hackathons encounter setup-related challenges, which can deeply hurt the attendee experience. Hence we've closely documented every step of the pre-requisite setup with links and explanations.

    Having as much of your environment pre-configured will provide you with an outstanding experience. You'll be able to follow along without getting stuck due to random issues.
    </Accordion>
    </Accordions>


<Callout type="warn" title="Git and GitHub are different things">
     Git is the tool that manages code history, while GitHub is a cloud platform for storing and sharing repositories.
     - Like what Microsoft Word is to Onedrive, or Google Docs is to Google Drive.
</Callout>

<Callout title="For a smooth workshop experience, changing the commands is not recommended, unless you're an experienced user.">
