<Tab value="MacOS">
MacOS is a UNIX-based operating system, so you can run everything in this workshop without any special configuration and can skip ahead :)

In simple terms, it's kind of like two people being from different countries but speaking the same language and understanding each other.

  <Accordions>
    <Accordion title="How does this work exactly?">
This is because both UNIX and Linux adhere to the [IEEE POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) (Portable Operating System Interface) standard.

[IEEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers) stands for 'Institute of Electrical and Electronics' engineers. It's a global not-for-profit that does many cool things, one of which is getting people to agree on common standards so that different technologies can work well with each other.

Many of the programs that work on Linux also work for MacOS. As a matter of fact, MacOS is actually powered by the [Darwin OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system)), which is based on [FreeBSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD).

FreeBSD powers extreme high-performance and cutting-edge network needs, such as Netflix's famous server infrastructure, Sony's Playstation OS (Orbis), and countless more.

Install [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What's WSL?">
Introduced by Microsoft in 2016, WSL allows people to run a real Linux kernel inside Windows.

Before WSL, people had to:
- Use a virtual machine, slow
- Dual boot on the same machine, tedious and risks bricking the machine
- Replace their main OS with Linux altogether, scary but the best option

You can learn more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux).

## System Requirements
    ### Install Homebrew
<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What's Homebrew?">
  [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is a **package manager**, which is a fancy term for **installer**. It's software for installing software, and works on both MacOS and Linux by softwareception. ðŸ¤¯
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

First, let's check if homebrew is installed on your machine.

```sh title="Terminal"
# Check Homebrew installation
brew --version
```

If you see something like `command not found`, continue with the installation. Otherwise, you can skip ahead to [Install Git](#install-git).

    <div className="steps">
      <div className="step">


    ```sh title="Terminal"
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

        After the installation, is complete, you'll see something like this.

<Callout>

Your output may be different. (In this case, `name` will be replaced with your username.)

Follow the on-screen instructions to add Homebrew to your `PATH`.
</Callout>
```txt
// [!code word:name]
- Run these commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH:
    echo >> /home/name/.bashrc // [!code highlight]
    echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /home/name/.bashrc // [!code highlight]
    eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)" // [!code highlight]
- Install Homebrew's dependencies if you have sudo access:
    sudo apt-get install build-essential // [!code highlight]
  For more information, see:
    https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux
- We recommend that you install GCC:
    brew install gcc // [!code highlight]
- Run brew help to get started
- Further documentation:
    https://docs.brew.sh
    ```

<Callout type="error" title="This is just an example. Don't copy-paste what's here on the site, look at your terminal! Replace `name` with your username.">
</Callout>

```sh title="Terminal"
    echo >> /home/name/.bashrc
```

<Callout type="error" title="This is just an example. This will be slightly different for MacOS.">
</Callout>
```sh title="Terminal"
    echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /home/name/.bashrc
```

<Callout  title="After you're done the two steps above, do these.">
</Callout>

```sh title="Terminal"
    sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

```sh title="Terminal"
    brew install gcc
```



<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Why are we using Homebrew for Ubuntu instead of apt?">
- Homebrew and `apt` [(Advanced Package Tool)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)) are both package managers.
- Yes, Ubuntu does ship with `apt`. We chose to go with `brew` to keep the documentation simpler.
- If someone downloads the LTS version of Ubuntu, they wouldn't be able to get the latest packages due to the version lock.
- Homebrew's Linux compatibility is fantastic, and it also has a very large package registry.

      ### Install [Git](https://git-scm.com)

      <div className="steps">
      <div className="step">
    ```sh title="Terminal"
    brew install git
    ```


      <div className="step">
Continue if you get `command not found`, otherwise skip ahead to [Install GitHub CLI](#install-github-cli).
```sh title="Terminal"
# Check Git version
git --version
```
</div>

      <div className="step">

#### Configure Git

Your username and email will be used to identify you in the Git commit history.
    ```sh title="Terminal"
    # Set your username
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    ```

    ```sh title="Terminal"
    # Set your email
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
    ```

    Git's default branch is `master`, let's change it to `main` to match the convention used by GitHub.
    ```sh title="Terminal"
    # Set the default branch to main
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
    ```

      </div>
      </div>
      </div>

    ### Install GitHub CLI

      <div className="steps">

      <div className="step">
If you see something like `command not found`, continue with the installation. Otherwise, you can skip ahead to [Install VS Code](#install-vs-code).

  ```sh title="Terminal"
  # Confirm GitHub CLI installation
  gh --version
  ```
  </div>

      <div className="step">

This simplifies GitHub tasks like cloning repositories, and authentication without needing to copy-paste URLs.
```sh title="Terminal"
brew install gh
```

Login with your GitHub account.
```sh title="Terminal"
gh auth login
```

Provide the following answers.
```
? Where do you use GitHub? [Use arrows] to move, type to filter]
> GitHub.com
  Other
```

```
? What is your preferred protocol for Git operations on this host? [Use arrows] to move, type to filter]
> HTTPS
  SSH
```

```
? Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials? [Use arrows] to move, type to filter]
> Yes
  No
```

```
? How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI? [Use arrows] to move, type to filter]
> Login with a web browser
  Paste an authentication token
```

Your one-time code will be different.
```
! First copy your one-time code: 95i2-DAE6
Press Enter to open github.com in your browser...
```

Open your browser, log in to GitHub and provide it permissions, and then come back to the terminal when you see the `Congratulations, you're all set!` screen.

You should see the following in your terminal
```
âœ” Authentication complete.
- gh config set -h github.com git_protocol https
âœ” Configured git protocol
âœ” Logged in as YourGitHubUsername
```
      </div>
      </div>

    ### Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

      <div className="steps">
      <div className="step">

```sh title="Terminal"
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

<Callout title="Wondering where to find these commands?">
- Go to [brew.sh](https://brew.sh)
- Search `VS Code`

You can search and find the commands for all of the packages we've installed so far.
</Callout>

    </div>
      </div>


### Check Your Setup

Confirm that your setup is correct by running these commands. If any fail, refer back to the corresponding setup instructions.

If it's working correctly, you'll see the relevant version number and configuration details.

```sh title="Terminal"
# Check Homebrew installation
brew --version
```

```sh title="Terminal"
# Check Git version
git --version
```

```sh title="Terminal"
# Confirm GitHub CLI installation
gh --version
```

```sh title="Terminal"
# Verify global Git config
git config --list
```
Press `q` to quit.


```sh title="Terminal"
# Open VS Code
code
```

<Callout type="error" title="Please ensure that your setup is complete before proceeding.">
</Callout>
