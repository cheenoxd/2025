## ‚öôÔ∏èSetup for NextAuth

### Create your prisma models

We first need to create a database for NextAuth to store user and token data. NextAuth can be used without a database, but we need it in 
order to persist user accounts.

```tsx
model Session {
  id           String   @id @default(cuid())
  sessionToken String   @unique @map("session_token")
  userId       String   @map("user_id")
  expires      DateTime
  user         User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  @@map("sessions")
}

model User {
  id            String    @id @default(cuid())
  email         String    @unique
  emailVerified DateTime? @map("email_verified")
  createdAt     DateTime  @default(now()) @map("created_at")
  updatedAt     DateTime  @updatedAt @map("updated_at")
  sessions      Session[]
  @@map("users")
}

model VerificationToken {
  identifier String
  token      String   @unique
  expires    DateTime
  @@unique([identifier, token])
  @@map("verification_tokens")
}
```

With these models, NextAuth automatically handles all authentication. Once a user is successfully logged in, NextAuth populates these fields to provide automatic authentication. 
Users can very easily be authenticated with hooks that will be explained below. The great thing with NextAuth is that we don‚Äôt need to worry about these at all.

### Configuration for NextAuth

Next, we need to configure NextAuth by adding a dynamic API route handler. This route lets NextAuth automatically handle NextAuth-related requests (i.e. signIn, signOut, 
callback, etc.). Our NextAuth config (`authOptions`) is located in `~/server/auth.ts` . Then, we let NextAuth access `authOptions` through a `route.ts` file located in 
`~/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` . 

<Callout>
NextAuth needs to use the `[...nextauth]` route. Before Next.js added App Routers in 13.2, you could have your authOptions in `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js` directly. 
Since we‚Äôre using a Next.js version above 13.2, NextAuth reccommends a setup like the one I described. Their tutorial can be found 
[here](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/initialization#route-handlers-app).

</Callout>

Our code should look something like this:

```tsx
// ~/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
import NextAuth from 'next-auth'

import { authOptions } from '~/server/auth'

const handler = NextAuth(authOptions)
export { handler as GET, handler as POST }
```

```tsx
// ~/server/auth.ts
...
export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
  events: {
    ...
  },
  callbacks: {
		...
  },
  adapter: PrismaAdapter(db) as Adapter,
  providers: [
    ...
  ],
}
...
```

There‚Äôs a lot more in authOptions than what you see above, but our source code should be fairly easy to read and understand with its comments.

### Adding a provider

In this project, we are exclusively using providers (e.g. Google, Discord, Github, etc.) to sign in our users. We define these providers in 
the `providers` array in our authOptions like so:

```tsx
export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
	...
  providers: [
    GoogleProvider({
      clientId: env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    }),
  ],
}
```

Providers like Google require additional setup to get the client id and client secret. There should be many tutorials for other providers, but our instructions 
for google can be found in [Contribution Guildines ‚Üí Quick Start](/docs/contribution-guidelines#additional-setup).

### Wrapping components around \<SessionProvider>

The last piece of setup is wrapping our components with a `<SessionProvider>` .

```tsx
<SessionProvider>
  {children}
</SessionProvider>
```

There are two ways to retrieve a user‚Äôs session. You can do so through `getServerSession(authOptions)` (or our wrapper: `getServerAuthSession()`) on the server-side or `useSession()` 
on the client side. If you want to use the `useSession()` hook, then you need it to be wrapped around `<SessionProvider>`. This allows instances of `useSession()` to share the session 
object across components and takes care of keeping the session updated and synced between tabs/windows. If you have pages that support both client and server-side rendering, then you
can pass in a `session={getServerSession(authOptions)}` page prop to avoid checking the session twice.

## üîíLogin Flow

### Creating a custom sign-in page

In the same folder where `[‚Ä¶nextauth]` is located (`~/app/api/auth/` ), create `/signIn/page.tsx`. `page.tsx` is your React sign-in page.

To make this the sign-in page used by NextAuth, add the `pages` option to authOptions. Then add the signIn callback and the route that your sign-in page is located in. 
It should look like this:

```tsx
export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
  ...
  pages: {
    signIn: '/api/auth/signIn',
  },
  ...
}
```

### Using the sign-in page

Now, you can use the `signIn()` method by NextAuth to send the user to your custom sign-in page. It‚Äôs not necessary, but it‚Äôs nice for creating standards. 
An example of a sign-in button component can be seen below:

```tsx
"use client";

import { signIn } from "next-auth/react";

export const SignInButton = () => {
  return (
    <button onClick={() => signIn()}>
      Sign in
    </button>
  );
}
```

In the sign-in page, a button to sign-in with Google can be added like so:

```tsx
"use client";

import { signIn } from 'next-auth/react';

export const GoogleSignInButton = () => {
  return (
    <button onClick={() => signIn('google')}>
      Sign in with Google
    </button>
  );
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏èProtecting Our Pages and Role-Based Authentication

In general, this works by adding a `role` property (if using jwt) to our users‚Äô tokens. We use that token to check the role of our users in our pages or in middleware. 
If the role is an admin, we allow them to access the admin page. Otherwise, we redirect them to an ‚Äúunauthorized‚Äù page.

### Adding a role property

We first want to start by customizing what is in our users‚Äô sessions and adding a `role` property to it. We can do this through the `profile()` callback in our providers 
like so:

```tsx
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import Google from "next-auth/providers/google";
 
export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
  providers: [
    Google({
	    clientId: env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
      profile(profile) {
      
	      // "user" will be the default
	      let userRole = "user";
	      
	      // add logic here to assign roles, for example:
	      if (profile?.email === "admin@gmail.com")
		      userRole = "admin";
	      
	      // add role to the user's profile object
        return { 
	        ...profile,
	        role: userRole
        };
      },
    })
  ],
}
```

### Allowing the role property to be used in our program

Now, we need to be able to use this `role` property inside our program. We do this by adding the `jwt()` and `session()` 
callback into our authOptions.

```tsx
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import Google from "next-auth/providers/google";
 
export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
  providers: [
    Google({
	    clientId: env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
      profile(profile) {
	      let userRole = "user";
	      
	      if (profile?.email === "admin@gmail.com")
		      userRole = "admin";
	      
        return { 
	        ...profile,
	        role: userRole
        };
      },
    })
  ],
  callbacks: {
    jwt({ token, user }) {
	    // add role to token to use on SERVER side
      if(user) 
	      token.role = user.role;
      return token;
    },
    session({ session, token }) {
	    // add role to session to use on CLIENT side, optional
	    if (session?.user)
		    session.user.role = token.role;
      return session;
    }
  }
}
```

### Protecting our pages

#### Option 1: Add protection to each page

This option is very simple and can be used if we have very little pages to protect. You can simply use the `getServerSession()` or `useSession()` 
hooks inside a page to access the user‚Äôs `role`. Using that, you can decide what to do based on their role. Below is a simple example of using 
`useSession()` to check if the user is an admin.

```tsx
import { useSession } from "next-auth/react";
 
export default function Page() {
  const session = await useSession();
	
  if (session?.user.role === "admin") {
	  // can redirect here
    return <p>You are an admin, welcome!</p>;
  }
 
  return <p>You are not authorized to view this page!</p>;
}
```

#### Option 2: Protection through middleware

This is only supported if we use the `jwt` session strategy.

Create a `middleware.ts` file on the root or src directory (same level as where you store your pages) to protect all pages. Adding this 
file makes users **require authentication**. If they aren‚Äôt authenticated, it redirects them to the sign-in page by default. Below is an 
example of basic `middleware.ts` setup:

```tsx
/*
if you only have this line, it protects all pages from unauthenticated users
and redirects them to the sign in page by default
*/
export { default } from "next-auth/middleware"

// add this line to choose/whitelist pages to secure
export const config = { matcher: ["/dashboard", "/admin"] }
```

If we want something more advanced then just securing pages from unauthenticated users, we need to wrap the middleware with `withAuth`. 
Using this wrapper, we have 2 more options to protect our admin pages. **(Option 1)** we can use the `authorized` callback, which if 
false, redirects the user to the sign in page (I‚Äôm not aware if you can customize the redirection). **(Option 2)** we can use the 
middleware function inside the wrapper and add our own custom logic. Below is an example that shows both options:

```tsx
import { withAuth } from "next-auth/middleware";

export default withAuth(
	/* Option 1 */
  // `withAuth` augments your `Request` with the user's token.
  function middleware(req) {
    if (
      req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith("/admin") && // not sure if first condition is necessary, just saw it in an example
      req.nextauth.token.role != "admin"
    )
      return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL("/Denied", req.url));
  },
  /* Option 2 */
  {
    callbacks: {
      authorized: ({ token }) => token?.role === "admin",
    },
  },
)

export const config = { matcher: ["/admin"] }
```

## üõ°Ô∏èAnother Method for Protection and Authentication

### Page Authentication

- The code example below shows a simple way to do FE authentication
- The example below takes advantage of NextJs‚Äôs server side rendering
- We get the session data on the server and then our component will have access to this session by calling useSession(). 
useSession() will access the props key from the return value of  `getServerSideProps()`
- Alternatively, we can retrieve session info on the client side by just using `useSession()` and eliminating `getServerSideProps`

```tsx
import { getServerAuthSession } from "../server/auth";
import { GetServerSideProps } from "next";
import { useSession } from "next-auth/react";

export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async (ctx) => {
  const session = await getServerAuthSession(ctx);
  return {
    props: { session },
  };
};

const User = () => {
  const { data: session } = useSession();
  // NOTE: session won't have a loading state since it's already prefetched on the server

  return (
    <div>
      {session ? (
        <div>
          <h1>Welcome, {session.user.name}</h1>
          <p>Email: {session.user.email}</p>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <p>You are not authenticated</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default User;

```

### Endpoint Authentication

1. Create our own getServerAuthSession in `/server/auth` . This is usefull so we don‚Äôt need to import getServerSession and authOptions everytime we need to access a session on the BE side

```tsx
export const getServerAuthSession = (ctx) => {
  return getServerSession(ctx.req, ctx.res, authOptions);
};
```

With what we have below, all our tRPC procedures have access to our session context, allowing them to be easily authenticated!

```tsx
import { getServerAuthSession } from "../auth";

export const createContext = async (opts) => {
  const { req, res } = opts;
  const session = await getServerAuthSession({ req, res });
  return await createContextInner({
    session,
  });
};
```

2. Create protection middleware. Middleware is something that we use to protect all of our endpoints. Essentially, all middleware will be run before calling an endpoint. 

```tsx
export const protectedProcedure = t.procedure.use(({ ctx, next }) => {
  if (!ctx.session || !ctx.session.user) {
    throw new TRPCError({ code: "UNAUTHORIZED" });
  }
  return next({
    ctx: {
      // infers the `session` as non-nullable
      session: { ...ctx.session, user: ctx.session.user },
    },
  });
});
```

We are able to create this middleware because of the createContext function we defined earlier that adds session to our context. Now if session is null or user is null, we can assume they are unauthenticated and return an error. 

3. Add middleware to an endpoint: 
We added protctedProcedure to the `me:` function, which means that only if a user is authenticated they will be able to access this function. 

```tsx
const userRouter = router({
  me: protectedProcedure.query(async ({ ctx }) => {
    const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
      where: {
        id: ctx.session.user.id,
      },
    });
    return user;
  }),
});
```
